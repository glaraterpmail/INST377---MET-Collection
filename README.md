# INST377---MET-Collection
________________________________________________
## Description

### An interactive website using The The Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) Collection's API to allow users to explore the museum's collection.

**Description:** The proposed system will leverage The Met's API to create an interactive website that allows users to explore the museum's collection. The system will provide detailed information about each artwork, high-resolution images, and the ability to search and filter based on various criteria. This will make it easier for users to discover and appreciate the vast array of art housed at The Met.

The app will allow users to:
* Explore artworks by different criteria (e.g., artist, period, department).
* View high-resolution images and detailed descriptions of artworks.
* Perform searches to discover specific pieces or types of art.
